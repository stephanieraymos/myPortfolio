              <p>If you're looking for someone who <strong>NEVER GIVES UP</strong>; you've landed exactly where you needed to.</p>
              <p>I have such an strong passion for programming. In my free time; you'll find me at my desk with a huge smile on my face. This is what I love to do. It's second nature to me; as easy as breathing.</p>
              <p>The issues and errors don't frustrate me because I know exactly where to look to find solutions. In fact; they're exciting to me, because once I've solved them; I've <strong>LEARNED</strong> something very valuable that will ultimately make me a much better coder.</p>
              <p>I am different in many ways, but I consider my most important attribute to be that I bring my positivity anywhere I go; spreading it to everyone I approach.</p>
